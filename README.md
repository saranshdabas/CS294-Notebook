# CS294-Notebook

This notebook calculates MEC, capacity progression and resilience of the Sign Language Dataset

We have followed the algorithm described in this paper: https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/paste/jeqdgp7ec8fv4/492346988fd3f0463cc2a49237ddee43b8ffbdb17ef381fc9c28b298aa70ccd8/chapter9.pdf

The algorithm described in the paper to calculate MEC is for balanced binary classes, we have simply extended it to un-balanced multi class classification.
